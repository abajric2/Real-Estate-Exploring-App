# Real Estate exploring app

The web application aims to streamline real estate exploration for users. 

Real estate listings can be filtered based on various criteria of interest, such as price range or square footage, according to their preferences. 

Additionally, users can view how many times a real estate listing has been searched or its details reviewed. 

Users have the ability to inspect the details of each real estate as well as read feedback from other users. Moreover, if logged into the application, they can also leave their own feedback on specific real estate listings.
